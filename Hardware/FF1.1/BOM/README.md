How To Use This
===============

Upload the 'ff1.1-bom.csv' to DigiKey. If some parts arenâ€™t in stock, it may barf. Your best bet is probably to remove them and find another supplier (likely this will be the LEDs, but maybe other things).

There are caveats:

* APA102C's, AKA DotStars on Adafruit may not be in stock on DigiKey. If not, you can buy them from Adafruit. You will need at least 10, though I recommend getting extra to fix ones that get damaged during assembly. They are also _much cheaper_ from EBay or Aliexpress
* The battery holder may not fit the through holes on the PCB. They were custom sized to fit exactly the cheap holders I got on Aliexpres.
